Data cleaning and visualization in MS Excel

Dataset used from GitHub.  Did some data cleaning and visualization with a pivot table and dashboard.  Each sheet within the spreadsheet will have a not to the right with short explanation.  

During the cleaning, IF function was used in a nested formula to return a few conditions.

Pivot tables created to organize and summarize the data a little bit more so I can use to create a dashboard.

Dashboard created to showcase data of customers that did/did not purchase a bike:
•	Average income per customer
•	Average customer age bracket
•	Customer typical commute distance that was reported
•	Customer with number of cars owned

A filter on the left is added with connection to each table that who needs that data can filter who has/has not purchased a bike based on marital status, region living in, or education.   Also, each table a listed drill-down box option.  And a pie chart is present to give a percentage of customers with vehicle(s) that purchased a bike.
