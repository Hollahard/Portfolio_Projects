In this "Working data" sheet, I have the copy of the original dataset of Bike Purchases. I am going through the process of cleaning the data - looking for duplicates, missing/incorrect data, convert or formatting. Marital Status and Gender columns, Changed entry to fully spell out versus using abbreviation since "M" was used within both columns. Listed income values were all whole number, so went ahead and did away with the decimal places. Created a column next to "Age" so can do an "Age Bracket" since so many ages listed. Make it a little more readable in a dashboard.

Pivot tables created to organize and summarize the data a little bit more so I can use to create a dashboard.

Dashboard created to showcase data of customer that did/did not purchase a bike: Average income per customer • Average customer age bracket • Customer typical commute distance that was reported Customer with number of cars owned A filter on the left is added with connection to each table that who needs that data can filter who has/has not purchased a bike based on martial status, region living in, or education. Also, each table a listed drill-down box option. And a pie chart is present to give a percentage of customers with vehicle(s) that purchased a bike.
